## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
A Web-Based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software could serve as an interactive platform designed to enhance the recruitment process for both job applicants and recruiters by simulating real-world hiring experiences. For applicants, it would offer a comprehensive suite of tools to create detailed profiles, apply for simulated jobs, participate in interview simulations (both video and text-based), take skills assessments, and receive personalized feedback on their performance, helping them refine their resumes and interview skills. Recruiters, on the other hand, could post job openings, screen applicants based on specific criteria, simulate interviews with tailored questions, and evaluate applicants through customizable tests, offering constructive feedback to improve their hiring strategies. The platform would also incorporate AI-driven coaching, gamification elements (like progress tracking, badges, and leaderboards), and industry-specific simulations for various sectors, providing both parties with a dynamic and engaging environment to practice and improve their recruitment and application skills. Ultimately, this simulation software would create a space for continuous learning and development, benefiting individuals and organizations alike by optimizing the hiring process, enhancing candidate preparation, and fostering a better understanding of job fit through real-time feedback and analytics.
